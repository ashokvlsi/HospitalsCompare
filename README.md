Hospitals Compare
==================

###Summary
> Based on the data (last update: 04/17/2014) from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the script does the follow:

> 1. Find the best hospital in a state for a given disease (heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia).
> 2. Find the hospital in a state having a given rank by the 30-day mortality rate of a given disease. 
> 3. Find the hospitals in all states across the U.S. having a given rank by the 30-day mortality rate of a given disease. 
> 4. Ranks the hospitals in a state by the 30-day mortality rate of a given disease.


> The result of each of the above tasks is output in the console. In addition, the result is output to a .csv file for Task 3 and Task 4. The script was produced using R x64 3.1.1 on Windows 7. The resulted tidy data set "tidyData.txt" and the Code Book are available in the main repo.
